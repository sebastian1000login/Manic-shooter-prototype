This is a prototype of a manic shooter I'm making. It's written in JavaScript using the littleJS engine.

Controls:

-Use WASD or arrow keys to move.

-Hold J to fire. 

-Hold I to move slower (Focus).


For now restart isn't implemented yet, so you have to reload the page every time you loose and if you win the only thing that will happen is that the enemy will stop shooting bullets.
